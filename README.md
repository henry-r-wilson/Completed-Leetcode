# Completed-Leetcode
All Completed LeetCode Submissions. All code comes with a description of what the code does, along with a line-by-line breakdown of what each line does. This is done in-case I need to revisit any code, and can't remember what each line does.

LeetCode runtime is notoriously inconsistent, as it can fluxuate heavily depending on how overloaded the LeetCode servers are (have seen in range +100 ms on the same piece of code minutes apart) so assess code as it's written, not on it's stated runtime.
